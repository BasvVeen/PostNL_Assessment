This is the repository for the coding Assessment for my PostNL application for the role of Junior Data Scientist.

The Assessment.ipynb contains the python code I used for this assessment, written in the format of a jupyter notebook. I have added comments and explanations to the code. To run the code, open the notebook in an interpreter and run pip install requirements.txt in the terminal to recreate the virtual environment I worked in.
